## In short
this is a task that utilizes image segmentation and mechanical implementation of automatic garbage sorting.

It wasn't a very difficult task, we took our own photos and annotated them, did a series of data enhancements, built our own machines, and then trained the YOLO models.

Our ultimate success depends on stability and plenty of alternatives.

In the regional final competition, the wires caused the coordinates to shift, which did not meet the best expectations, but our lower limit still beat the others.

A few days before the competition, I stayed up all night tweaking the software, and my teammates stayed up all night tweaking the mechanics.

The day before the final, we checked the logic in the hotel, discussed bugs, and made two backup plans to prevent accidents.

It's a really fun experience to focus on one competition with all attention for a few days.

Forget all the chores, and try to do the best.

I rarely participate in team competitions (I think I'm too introverted).

There's a picture of me, by the way:

## Later

We are going to the national competition in December and I hope to get the first place in the country.

This is not a difficult task, but we have to think about how to do it perfectly.

    height: 300px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .image-container img {
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
  }

  .image-container:hover img {
    opacity: 1;
  }
