## Self Introduction

Autonym: YuXuan Wu; Pseudonym: Horikita Saku

Majored in artificial intelligence as an undergraduate.

Interested in the intersection of data science and natural sciences, particularly in the realms of biological information and astrophysical.

Currently conducting research on discrete representation and AI applications in bioinformatics and medicine at the National University of Singapore, including GWAS and single-cell analysis.

At the same time, I studied the application of nonlinear methods in GWAS at NUS.

Kaggle Expert.

## My personality

I appreciate quiet spaces, reading, listening to the rain and relishing a good cup of coffee.

My favorite book is *If On a Winter's Night a Traveler*. 

Probably a bit workaholic.
