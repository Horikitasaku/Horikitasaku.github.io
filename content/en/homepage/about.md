## Self Introduction

Autonym: YuXuan Wu; Pseudonym: Horikita Saku

Majored in artificial intelligence as an undergraduate.

Specializes in Data Science and the intersection with the natural sciences.

Currently being explored in astrophysical and biological information.

Kaggle Expert.

## My personality

The meaning of my life is given by knowledge, like the fire which is fueled by books.

Like peace, reading, rain and coffee. Detest hypocrisy, politics, meaninglessness.

Favorite Book is *If On a Winter's Night a Traveller*.

Probably a bit of a workaholic.
