      Predict the area ratio of planets and stars and the confidence level (uncertainty) sigma.

      - Achieved the 7th(1%) in the NeurIPS Competition. Achieve my first gold medal.
  
      - We have developed a method that spans from heuristic forward modeling to Gaussian processes, to deep learning, and to gradient boosting trees.
  
      - Become Kaggle Competition Masters.
