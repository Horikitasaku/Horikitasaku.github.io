## Self Introduction

Autonym: YuXuan Wu; Pseudonym: Horikita Saku

Majored in artificial intelligence as an undergraduate.

Interested in the intersection of data science and natural sciences, particularly in the realms of astrophysical and biological information.

Currently working on a Python library focused on protein embedding for computational biology.

Kaggle Expert.

## My personality

I appreciate quiet spaces, reading, listening to the rain and relishing a good cup of coffee.

My favorite book is *If On a Winter's Night a Traveler*. 

Probably a bit workaholic.
