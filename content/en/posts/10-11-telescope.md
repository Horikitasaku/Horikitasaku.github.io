At first, there seemed to be a problem with the auto-calibration, so I have to use the finderscope to find planets manually.

Manual adjustment means that planets cannot be automatically tracked, and they quickly disappear from view, so only low-power eyepieces can be used.

I got the following photos:

It's already beautiful. Rings of Saturn are perfect.

But I am not willing to use such a low power eyepiece.

Attempts at automatic calibration using Vega and Saturn, which have been found, were ultimately successful.

I got clearer pictures.

Astronomy is absolutely romantic, and seeing the stars with my own eyes is amazing.
